       The Environment Setup page is one of the most important parts of the Programming
       Guide, and it frequently changes. In November 2024, Intel introduced a new
       default installation directory for both Windows and Linux. Those who use custom
       directories would not have any issues. But users who accept default directories
       would need to customize configuration files, point scripts to the new location
       for libraries and compilers, and alter their PATH.
       
       My role in this project was to rewrite the entire Development Environment Setup
       pages, verify it with engineering, validate it with our validation team, and
       coordinate updating 180 documents to point users to this content so they would
       be aware of the change to default installation methods.




`How to use CMake with Intel® oneAPI Toolkits <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/how-to-use-cmake-with-intel-oneapi-toolkits.html>`_ 

With the December 2023 release, configuration options changed so that users had options when
configuring their systems. I worked with a developer to write this article
explaining how users can configure CMake to automatically trigger configuration
options.

`Get Started with the Intel® oneAPI Base Toolkit for Linux <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/oneapi-base-toolkit/get-started-guide-linux/2024-0/overview.html>`_

This document started in 2019 with monthly beta releases as we worked toward a
viable product. This shows how a user can configure their system, install
necessary drivers, and run a sample to verify their installation is working and
begin learning how to take advantage of the features in the toolkit.

The Get Started
Guides are key for users to configure their system and verify that the
components are installed correctly. Then users can try a sample to see how the
software works. This page shows how to use the User Interface to run a sample in
Windows.


`Using Visual Studio Code with Intel® oneAPI Toolkits User Guide <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/oneapi/user-guide-vs-code/2024-0/overview.html>`_

After the beta launch of Intel oneAPI components, we focused on usability and
creating a familiar experience for developers by creating Visual Studio Code
extensions that enhance development with Intel oneAPI components. This user
guide documented how to install and use the extensions as well as configuring VS
Code for different environments.
