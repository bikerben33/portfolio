`Intel® oneAPI Programming Guide Development Environment Setup <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/oneapi/programming-guide/2024-2/oneapi-development-environment-setup.html>`_

The Environment Setup page is one of the most important parts of the Programming
Guide, and it frequently changes. In November 2024, Intel introduced a new
default installation directory for both Windows and Linux. Those who use custom
directories would not have any issues. But users who accept default directories
would need to customize configuration files, point scripts to the new location
for libraries and compilers, and alter their PATH.

My role in this project was to rewrite the entire Development Environment Setup
pages, verify it with engineering, validate it with our validation team, and
coordinate updating 180 documents to point users to this content so they would
be aware of the change to default installation methods.



Using Visual Studio Code with Intel® oneAPI Toolkits User Guide
===============================================================

After the beta launch of Intel oneAPI components, we focused on usability and
creating a familiar experience for developers by creating Visual Studio Code
extensions that enhance development with Intel oneAPI components. This user
guide documented how to install and use the extensions as well as configuring VS
Code for different environments.
